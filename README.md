# Attestar

**Continuous, private proof of solvency for stablecoin and RWA issuers on Stellar.**

An issuer proves on-chain that its reserves cover every holder balance, without revealing a single account, a single custodian, or even the totals. The verdict is a zero-knowledge SNARK verified inside a Soroban smart contract.

Attestar is proof-of-reserves that a regulator would accept and a competitor cannot read. An issuer keeps its customer ledger and its reserve composition private, generates a Groth16 proof **in the browser** that `on-chain USDC + private off-chain reserves >= liabilities`, and submits it with a **Freighter**-signed transaction. The Soroban contract verifies the proof against Stellar's native **BN254** host functions and substitutes the issuer's **real on-chain USDC balance** as the only public reserve input, so the number cannot be faked. Holders independently verify their own inclusion; a regulator with a view key reconstructs the full breakdown. This is the always-on, cryptographic complement to the monthly accounting attestation that the US **GENIUS Act** and EU **MiCA** now require.

## The problem

Proof-of-reserves today is a PDF. An accounting firm signs a point-in-time attestation once a month, you take it on faith, and nothing is verifiable in between. That model has already failed in public: USDC depegged to $0.87 in March 2023 when 8% of its reserves were trapped at Silicon Valley Bank, Tether has still never completed a Big-Four audit, and in 2026 a regulated exchange kept asserting solvency while its hot wallet drained to nothing. Meanwhile the GENIUS Act and MiCA have turned voluntary attestation into a legal mandate with monthly reserve disclosure and officer certification.

The obvious fix, put reserves and liabilities on-chain, breaks on privacy. A stablecoin or tokenized-fund issuer cannot publish its customer ledger or reveal which banks hold how much of its reserves; that is competitively and legally radioactive. So issuers are stuck between an unverifiable monthly PDF and a transparency they cannot accept.

Zero-knowledge dissolves the tradeoff. Attestar proves the *property* you care about, reserves cover liabilities, every epoch and on-chain, while the underlying figures stay private. Verifiable transparency for the public, full disclosure for the regulator, secrecy from everyone else.

## What it proves

The circuit takes two private vectors and one public number and proves a single inequality in zero knowledge:

    end

    end

    class L,R priv
    class O pub
    class CIRC,OUT circ
```

- Every balance is **range-checked** (`Num2Bits(64)`), which blocks the classic proof-of-reserves fraud of hiding liabilities behind negative leaves.
- Both totals stay private. Only two Poseidon **root commitments**, the boolean **verdict**, and the issuer's real **on-chain USDC** are public.
- Because the contract supplies the on-chain figure itself, a prover cannot overstate reserves: the four public signals must match the proof exactly or verification fails.

- **Issuer** edits a private liability ledger and private reserve sources, proves solvency in the browser, and publishes with their wallet. Draining real USDC and re-publishing flips the on-chain verdict to `INSOLVENT`. The issuer cannot publish a `SOLVENT` lie, because the verdict is computed inside the proof against the real on-chain balance.
- **Holder** connects a wallet and verifies a Merkle inclusion path proving their own balance is counted in the proven liabilities, seeing only their own number.
- **Regulator** connects the authorized wallet, signs an audit-access message, and decrypts the issuer's disclosure package to reconstruct every holder balance and every reserve source. Selective disclosure, on demand.

## The honest boundary

Zero-knowledge proves two things trustlessly: the liabilities committed in the tree, and the on-chain reserves the contract reads itself. It cannot prove that an **off-chain bank balance exists**; that figure enters the proof as a value the issuer commits to, attestable by a custodian ed25519 signature (the contract supports this path). Attestar makes everything around the monthly audit continuous and verifiable, and binds the off-chain figure to a signature, but it complements the accounting attestation rather than replacing the auditor. We state this plainly because understanding the boundary is the difference between a real privacy product and an overclaim.

## What is real vs. illustrative

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| The ZK circuit, proving, and on-chain BN254 verification | **Real.** 30,284-constraint Groth16 circuit, verified on Stellar testnet. |
| Reserves (on-chain portion) | **Real Circle USDC** on testnet, read trustlessly by the contract. Drain is a real Freighter-signed USDC transfer. |
| Wallet signing | **Real Freighter** for all three roles. |
| Holder liability ledger and off-chain reserve sources | **Illustrative example data**, edited in-browser. In production these are the issuer's real private records. They are *meant* to be private and off-chain; that is the point of the ZK. |
| Off-chain fiat existence | Enters as a committed/attested figure (the honest boundary above). |

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node 20+, pnpm 10 (`corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@10.10.0 --activate`), and for rebuilding the ZK + contract: Rust, the `stellar` CLI, and `circom` 2.2 (on Windows these run in WSL). A **Freighter** wallet on **testnet** with a USDC trustline and a little testnet USDC (from [faucet.circle.com](https://faucet.circle.com)).

Run the web app against the live testnet deployment:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @attestar/sdk build
pnpm --filter attestar-client --filter mock-token-client build
pnpm web:dev        # http://localhost:3100
```

`apps/web/.env.local` is preconfigured with the deployed contract IDs above. Connect Freighter, then: **Activate verifier** (one-time), **Generate proof**, **Sign & publish** (SOLVENT), **Drain USDC**, re-publish (INSOLVENT). Switch roles from the header to verify inclusion as a holder and unlock disclosure as a regulator.

Rebuild the ZK core and redeploy from scratch (WSL):

```bash
# 1. circuit: compile + Groth16 trusted setup (depth 4 liabilities / depth 3 reserves)
cd packages/circuits
bash scripts/ptau.sh 16
bash scripts/build.sh psolvency_demo
node scripts/encode_vk.mjs psolvency_demo        # -> arg_vk.json (for the contract / web)
node scripts/encode_p.mjs                         # -> Rust test fixtures (real proofs)

# 2. contract: build + test against the real BN254 host crypto
cd ../contracts && stellar contract build && cargo test -p attestar

# 3. deploy + initialize with the real USDC SAC as reserve_token, admin = your Freighter address,
#    then point apps/web/.env.local at the new contract id and copy the proving assets into
#    apps/web/public/circuit (psolvency_demo.wasm + .zkey) and apps/web/lib/vk.json.
```

See [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) for the original design notes and the research that validated the idea.
